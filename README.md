# tutorials
MIT-licensed tutorials related to Python and Python data analysis libraries.

The first set of tutorials is purely related to Python:

* **Python Tutorials**
    * 101: Python for Newbies
    * 201: Python for Devs (Part 1)
    * 202: Python for Devs (Part 2)

Videos of these Python tutorials and the instructions for setting up your environment to execute the presentation are found here [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0K68QsPLDatdljp-9M3eP3W086y98ruc). These Python tutorials unsurprisingly require Python, which is available for free via [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The second set of tutorials is related to Python data analysis libraries and processing data via Jupyter:

* **Journeys in Jupyter**
    * 101: Python Data Ecosystem
    * 201: Cleaning Data
    * 202: Basic Automation
    * 203: Basic Machine Learning

Videos of the Jupyter tutorials and instructions for setting up your environment are found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0K68QsPLDasgvcTuDnNCF5JX21o2YX67). These tutorials require the Jupyter notebook, which can be most easily be downloaded for free via [Anaconda.org](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
