    "* `Escape` takes you to Command Mode, which is used for the notebook as a whole.\n",
    "* `Return` takes you to Edit Mode, which is used for editing individuals cells.\n",
    "* `Shift + Enter` or `Control + Enter` runs a cell.\n",
    "* Pressing the `H` key in Command Mode brings up the Help Screen.\n",

    "\n",
    "Command Mode is used to run cells or interact with the notebook as a whole. While the cell is selected and in Command Mode, press `B`. This will insert a cell underneath it (you are not expected to memorize this ... know that pressing `H` in command mode brings up a Help Screen). You can get into Command Mode from Edit Mode by pressing `Enter`.\n",

A <font color='#009f00'>vertical green bar</font>  should appear to the left of the cell. This bar indicates that you are in Edit Mode. You can now change the contents of this cell, and when you have completed your edits press `Shift + Enter` to input them and switch back to Command Mode. Try changing the \"cell to tinker with\" cell and changing its contents. Feel free to change it back and forth from markdown to code.

    "* **Cell**: allows you to run an individual cell, run a series of cells, change a cell type, and clear/show cell output.\n",
